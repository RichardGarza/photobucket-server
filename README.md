This is a Full Stack MERN Application.

The front end of this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The backend API uses Node.js, Express.js, Passport.js, & MongoDB.

In this project's directory, you can run:

`npm start` to run the application.
or
`npm run dev` to run the application with nodemon which will restart the server if any changes are made.

Then, ONCE SERVER IS RUNNING,
open a new terminal and run:
`npm run test`
